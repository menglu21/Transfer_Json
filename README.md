# Transfer_Json

The initial Json files are found from https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-muonPOG/muonefficiencies/-/tree/master/Run2/UL/2017/2017_highPt
1. the reco is the initial one
2. the id one is extracted from the "IDISO" one, with only the "NUM_HighPtID_DEN_GlobalMuonProbes" part is stored
3. the iso one is extracted from the "IDISO" one, with only the "NUM_probe_LooseRelTkIso_DEN_HighPtProbes" is stored
4. the highptMu.root includes all the three files
